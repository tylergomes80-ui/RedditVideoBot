So last weekend, my sister (25F) and I (28M) were coming back from this fancy gala thing. She was in this long shiny gold pattern dress like, proper full length gown and I was wearing a plain black suit. It was around 10:30 in the midnight, pitch dark, and we were driving on this completely deserted road. No streetlights. No cars. Just endless trees on both sides. Like, proper middle of nowhere vibes. After about 20 mins of driving, she suddenly said, \u201cI need to pee. Like now.\u201d I thought she was joking, but she was serious. So I pulled over onto the shoulder, but the side of the road was full of dry thorny plants and rough stuff nothing you\u2019d want to squat over, especially not in a dress like hers.",

We walked like 100 meters into the woods using my phone flashlight, just far enough so no one from the road could see us though honestly, there was no one to see anyway. She finally found a tiny clearing and told me to turn around. Her dress was a pain in the ass she had to gather all the fabric up and hold it high around her waist just so she could squat without messing it up. She looked super awkward trying not to trip over it. Anyway, I turned around, stood a few steps away, and also decided to pee while we were there. Out of respect and weirdness, we agreed to turn off the flashlight. Total blackout. Only sound was just\u2026 yeah, you know. Peeing. On dry leaves.",

      "text": "And then no joke she SCREAMED. Like, blood curdling scream. I panicked, still mid piss, and spun around trying to turn the flashlight back on. She was still squatting, dress in hands, completely freaked out, looking behind her. I asked, \u201cWhat happened??\u201d and she just stared at me and said, \u201cSomeone touched me. On both shoulders. Like, actual hands.\u201d I swear on everything there was no one around us. I immediately did a 360 with the light, shining it between trees and bushes, even looking up like a maniac. But there was nothing. No animal sounds. No rustling. Just silent woods. She was almost crying, trying to adjust her dress again, and it was taking forever. In that moment, while she was still fixing herself, I heard footsteps. I\u2019m not exaggerating it was like someone slowly stepping on leaves, circling us. Not fast. Just... deliberate. I didn\u2019t say anything at first because I didn\u2019t want to freak her out more.",

We ran in the direction we thought the car was, but we couldn\u2019t find it. It was like we came out from a different part of the woods or something. Panic started setting in because it felt like we were going in circles. Then we noticed this weird dark hollow in the trees about 100 meters aheadlike a cave opening or somethingbut we didn\u2019t dare go near it. Eventually, after for like 7 minutes, we finally hit the road again. But not where we entered. We had come out a good half kilometer away from the car. When we saw it, we sprinted toward it,and locked the doors, and didn\u2019t speak the entire ride back to the hotel. I\u2019ve never seen my sister that shaken. She\u2019s not the type to make up weird ghosty stuff.",
